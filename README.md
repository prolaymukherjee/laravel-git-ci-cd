# Laravel CI/CD Setup Documentation

## Overview

This guide provides step-by-step instructions to set up branch protection rules, add collaborators, and configure GitHub Actions for continuous integration (CI) in your project. Follow these steps to ensure your repository is well-managed and your CI/CD pipeline is working correctly.

## 1. Setting Up Branch Protection Rules

Branch protection rules help maintain code quality by enforcing specific policies on your branches.

### Steps:

1. **Navigate to Repository Settings:**
   - Go to your GitHub repository.
   - Click on the `Settings` tab.

2. **Access Branch Protection Rules:**
   - In the left sidebar, click on `Branches`.

3. **Create a Branch Protection Rule:**
   - Under `Branch protection rules`, click `Add rule`.
   - In the `Branch name pattern` field, enter the branch name you want to protect (e.g., `main` or `develop`).

4. **Configure Rule Requirements:**
   - **Require a pull request before merging:** Check this box to ensure all changes go through a pull request.
   - **Require approvals:** Select the number of required reviews from collaborators before merging a pull request.
   - **Do not allow bypassing the above settings:** Check this box to prevent anyone from bypassing the branch protection rules.

5. **Save the Rule:**
   - Click `Create` or `Save changes` to apply the rule.

## 2. Adding Collaborators

Collaborators are individuals who can contribute to your repository. Follow these steps to add new collaborators:

### Steps:

1. **Navigate to Repository Settings:**
   - Go to your GitHub repository.
   - Click on the `Settings` tab.

2. **Access Collaborators Settings:**
   - In the left sidebar, click on `Collaborators & teams`.

3. **Add a New Collaborator:**
   - Click the `Add people` button.
   - Enter the GitHub username of the person you want to add.
   - Click `Add` to send an invitation.

4. **Confirm Addition:**
   - The person will receive an invitation to join the repository. They need to accept the invitation to gain access.

## 3. Configuring GitHub Actions for CI/CD

GitHub Actions automates your workflow with CI/CD. Follow these steps to set up a CI workflow:

### Steps:

1. **Create GitHub Actions Folder:**
   - In your repository, navigate to the root directory.
   - Create a folder named `.github` if it does not exist.
   - Inside the `.github` folder, create another folder named `workflows`.

2. **Add CI Workflow File:**
   - Inside the `workflows` folder, create a file named `ci.yml`.

3. **Edit `ci.yml` File:**
   - Open the `ci.yml` file and add the following configuration:

     ```yaml
     name: Laravel CI Pipeline

     on:
       push:
         branches:
           - '**'
       pull_request:
         branches:
           - '**'

     jobs:
       build:
         runs-on: ubuntu-latest

         steps:
           # Checkout the code
           - name: Checkout repository
             uses: actions/checkout@v3

           # Cache Composer dependencies to speed up builds
           - name: Cache Composer dependencies
             uses: actions/cache@v3
             with:
               path: vendor
               key: composer-${{ hashFiles('composer.lock') }}
               restore-keys: |
                 composer-

           # Install Composer dependencies
           - name: Install Composer dependencies
             run: composer install

           # Run Laravel Pint for code style
           - name: Run Laravel Pint for code style
             run: vendor/bin/pint --test

           # Run Laravel Tests
           - name: Run Laravel Tests
             run: |
               php artisan test || echo "Tests failed, but continuing to next steps"

           # Notify on failure
           - name: Notify on failure
             if: failure()
             run: echo "Tests or some other steps failed. Review the logs for details."

           # Notify on success
           - name: Notify on success
             if: success()
             run: echo "All checks passed successfully!"
     ```

4. **Commit and Push Changes:**
   - Commit the `.github/workflows/ci.yml` file to your repository.
   - Push the changes to GitHub.
